# OJD-Map
A map of Ole-Johan Dahls hus for students at UiO, with A* pathfinding.

Working demo: <a href="https://joexbayer.github.io/OJD-Map/">Click here!</a>
<br>

<h3>Use:</h3>
To find a room either click it on the map!
<br>
You can also search for room names or roomid on the left.
<br>
A red button in the right top corner lets the user see the node
map,
which the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* pathfinding uses.</a>
(Mainly for debugging purposes)
<br>
Easily expandable with a RoomDB file which is loaded.
(Works as long as the room node is connected to the node network.)
All node positions and distance calculation is done in percentage to
ensure resposive design.
